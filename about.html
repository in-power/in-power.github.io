            <p class="purposetext">Self-care is an enormous industry, improving millions of lives around the world, 
                yet it lacks tremendously in one area; <b>commitment</b>. Many users admit to having downloaded a health app 
                for a very short period of time and deleting it within a month of its installation. Even our founder - Adam Kablawi. <br><br>
                This predicament called for a solution that consistently engaged users in self-nurturing
                activities numerous times daily. We call this carefully researched solution, the "Essence Battery". Your "Essence Battery"
                is constantly drained throughout your day by working, interacting, and even just living. <br><br>As a consumer 
                of my app, your goal is to recharge your battery numerous times throughout your day by engaging in the simplest mindful,
                physical, and spiritual activities provided by the InPower app. You will soon notice results such as an increase in 
                focus, cognitive ability, physical strength, physical confidence, wisdom, and positivity. <br><br>Your battery is dying for
                a charge, so lets plug it in together!</p>
